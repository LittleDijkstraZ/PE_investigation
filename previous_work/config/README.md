Deprecated. All experiments here can be reproduced using the configs in the config2/ directory. We recommend using the config files there.

Configs here requires creating .bin files and meta.pkl files for both train and test data,
which can be done by running a .ipynb file in the same directory as the data.

Set the argument --data_type='binary' to use the .bin and meta.pkl files.
